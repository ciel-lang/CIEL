  # Build on Debian and SBCL.
  # We want to build CIEL in a sufficiently old Debian version:
  # the glibc will be compatible with lots of Debian and Ubuntu systems,
  # however building on the latest (Bullseye) would lead to incompatible glibc errors
  # when running on newer systems.
  # Buster: released in July, 2019.
  # Bullseye: released in August, 2021, supported until July, 2024.
